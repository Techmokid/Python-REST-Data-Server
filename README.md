This is a fully functional data entry API server written in python.

To run, simply execute "main.py" and it will boot up.

This uses data visibility (Should unauthorised clients be able to view data or not per client entry), as well as hashes for security purposes so only the client program can edit the data.
This also uses timestamps so repeat command attacks are not possible
